# Mailroom
- Objective:
  - Create a functioning mailroom simulator that uses stacks to implement an organized system for packages and discards them in a timely fashion
- Constraints:
  - Each package stack can only hold up to 7 packages
  - The stacks are filled alphabetically by name so there is a stack A-G, H-J, K-M, N-R, S-Z
  - However if one stack is full it it will go to the nearest stack
  - The floor is infinite and will never fill up
  - Packages are discarded after 5 days
- Needs to do:
  - Get Packages for a user - gets the topmost package for a user
  - Deliver Package
  - Make it tomorrow
  - Print the stacks
  - Move a package from one stack to another
  - Find packages in the wrong stack and move to Floor
  - List all the packages awaiting a user
  - Empty the floor, moving all packages to the trash.
